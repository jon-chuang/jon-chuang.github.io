30 Day Thought Dump: Day 1.2

Title: Extracting More out of Time

Distraction is something we struggle with in the modern world. I find that exercising can help sublimate thoughts, providing blood flow and making one aware of and be in sync with one's body. Somehow, it helps put me in control. 

At the same time, I know that making progress on hard problems can often involve long stretches of loading the mind with the raw data and assimilating this data by looking at it from multiple angles. In sports, this is called "visualization". Training the mind, however, can be a lot more tricky. However, just like with sports, the raw phenomena simply needs multiple exposures (spaced repetition) and increasing the challenge can cause greater integration and progress.

As far as recovering from heavy overloading, breaks can certainly help. And I find that my best moments thinking are after an intense workout - my brain is getting lots of fresh oxygen, I am relaxed, and I can think through hard problems with ease.

There is a theory that the mind needs to be put in a relaxed and trance-like state in order to crystalize the patterns in the unused areas and to make long-distance connections. There is also a theory of memory - short and long-term memory; here we are (lossily) transmuting short term to long term memory.

Truly deep thought can be extremely hard on the mind, and one should do relaxing tasks in between. Changing one's environment can also help, perhaps by the use of place cells and some sort of reconfiguration of the neuron firing patterns leads to greater capacity. There is some relationship between mental exertion and alpha/beta/gamma waves. I think somewhere it's been found that short breaks can lead to greater overall performance and is correlated with less of the bad waves, whereas extended periods of exertion leads to a more sustained phenomenon of the bad waves (whichever they were).

All of this explains why it is extremely hard to adapt to new routines and environments - especially if you have to plan everything by yourself. I'll be experimenting with tools (including AI tools) for planning and ingesting via different modalities (text, audio via TTS, AI-generated diagrams / timetables). Stay tuned.
