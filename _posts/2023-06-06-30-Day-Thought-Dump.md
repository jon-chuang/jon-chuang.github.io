30 Day Thought Dump: Day 1.1

Today marks the first day of my 30 day thought dump. I will allow myself to post multiple times in a single day. The number proceeding "Day" is the day, a period, and then the post number for that day. This is to encourage a minimally-inhibited stream of thought style of generating output. For certain reasons I don't like twitter, in particular the fact that threads are horrifically ugly and I prefer long-form writing. I have been accumulating strands of thought in hackmd.io. They are mostly also thought dumps.

I find that writing helps focus the mind and refine thoughts. 

The benefit of making something public is that one has a chance to reflect upon it and refine it. But limited as the human mind is, we forget, things escape our grasp, we are mentally overloaded. The purpose of learning and training one's mind over time is to crystalize in the form of neurons the patterns and connections that assist one in one's anticipated activities at various future timescales and levels of exertion (frequent/rare, soon/distant, intuitive/hard). The raw data of living and learning needs to be transformed, sublimated, and refined into higher versions of oneself and of mind.

There is a balance to be struck between paring down a public representation of one's thoughts or work, and refining it internally in one's mind - choosing beforehand which paths are worth going down and finding the minimal ways of expressing it. But I think that the very act of expressing oneself is important and is a process of continual refinement.

If I don't like what I wrote, I can always also delete it in the future.

If it seems meaningful, perhaps enabling public comments may also provide meaningful interaction in the future.

Here marks the end of the first post.
